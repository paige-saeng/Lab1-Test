    <h2> Profile </h2>
    <p> As a data scientist, my passion lies in deciphering human behavior through data analysis and applying these insights to understand the intricacies of contemporary culture. 
        Drawing inspiration from the visionary approach of Carrie Bradshaw in "Sex and the City," who seamlessly blended data with cultural exploration, I embodied this in my projects. She explored New York's dating culture for thirty-year-old women, posing questions like, "Are New Yorkers evolving past relationships? Are women taking longer to get married?”. I realized that these questions mirror the essence of data science and have inspired me to bridge the gap between quantitative insights and the qualitative richness of cultural phenomena.
